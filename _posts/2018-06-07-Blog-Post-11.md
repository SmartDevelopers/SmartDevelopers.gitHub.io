    <td>Even though I didn't attend the last two lessons I was able to catch up on what I missed. I understand that I missed one Python lesson in which we continued to do the work on Python.
I then found out that I hadn’t missed the second 'I.T’ lesson as it was a bank holiday. I intend to catch up on any missed Python work.</td>
